# Lindenmayer system

An [L-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) is a very simple token-replacement system that can be used to create surprisingly complex results. In this workshop, we'll create a command line tool for interpreting L-systems and rendering them as images.

The interpreter will parse arbitrary L-systems in a format that we'll define. It will take the starting _axiom_ (the input to the L-system) as a command line argument, and it will render the resulting image using turtle graphics.
